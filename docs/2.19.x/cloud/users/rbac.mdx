User and Service Account Roles 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Custom tiers](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) allow you to set team member access to the appropriate level within specific workspaces.

Role-based access controls (RBAC) enable you to assign users granular permissions to perform certain activities.

To give users access to functionality beyond the scope of Prefect’s built-in workspace roles, Custom account Admins can create custom roles for users.

Built-in roles
---------------------------------------------------

Roles give users abilities at either the account level or at the individual workspace level.

*   An _account-level role_ defines a user's default permissions within an account.
*   A _workspace-level role_ defines a user's permissions within a specific workspace.

The following sections outline the abilities of the built-in, Prefect-defined ac and workspace roles.

### Account-level roles

The following built-in roles have permissions across an account in Prefect Cloud.

Custom workspace roles
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The built-in roles will serve the needs of most users, but your team may need to configure custom roles, giving users access to specific permissions within a workspace.

Custom roles can inherit permissions from a built-in role. This enables tweaks to the role to meet your team’s needs, while ensuring users can still benefit from Prefect’s default workspace role permission curation as new functionality becomes available.

Custom workspace roles can also be created independent of Prefect’s built-in roles. This option gives workspace admins full control of user access to workspace functionality. However, for non-inherited custom roles, the workspace admin takes on the responsibility for monitoring and setting permissions for new functionality as it is released.

See [Role permissions](#workspace-role-permissions) for details of permissions you may set for custom roles.

After you create a new role, it become available in the account **Members** page and the **Workspace Sharing** page for you to apply to users.

### Inherited roles

A custom role may be configured as an **Inherited Role**. Using an inherited role allows you to create a custom role using a set of initial permissions associated with a built-in Prefect role. Additional permissions can be added to the custom role. Permissions included in the inherited role cannot be removed.

Custom roles created using an inherited role will follow Prefect's default workspace role permission curation as new functionality becomes available.

To configure an inherited role when configuring a custom role, select the **Inherit permission from a default role** check box, then select the role from which the new role should inherit permissions.
