[Prefect recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes) are common, extensible patterns for setting up Prefect in your execution environment with ready-made ingredients such as Dockerfiles, Terraform files, and GitHub Actions.

Recipes are useful when you are looking to deploy an agent, use event-driven flows, set up unit testing, and more.

The following are Prefect recipes specific to Prefect 2. You can find a full repository of recipes at [https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes) and additional recipes at [Prefect Discourse](https://discourse.prefect.io/).
