title: Prefect REST API Reference
---

Both Prefect Cloud and locally run Prefect Orion servers host a REST API that gives you access to many observability, coordination, and account management functions of the platform.

Prefect Cloud REST API documentation is available at <a href="https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs" target="_blank">https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs</a>.

The Prefect Orion REST API documentation for locally run open-source Prefect Orion servers is available below.
