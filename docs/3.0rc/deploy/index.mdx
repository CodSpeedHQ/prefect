[Deployments](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/prefect-deploy/) are server-side representations of flows. 
They store the crucial metadata for remote orchestration including when, where, and 
how a workflow should run.

Attributes of a deployment include:

- **Flow entrypoint**: path to your flow function
- **Schedule** or **Trigger**: optional schedule or triggering rules for this deployment
- **Tags**: optional text labels for organizing deployments

Some of the most common reasons to use an orchestration tool like Prefect are for 
[scheduling](/3.0rc/automate/add-schedules/) and [event-based triggering](/3.0rc/automate/events/automations-triggers/).
As opposed to manually triggering and managing flow runs, deploying a flow exposes an API and 
UI that allow you to:

- trigger new runs, [cancel active runs](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/#cancel-a-flow-run), 
pause scheduled runs, customize parameters, and more
- remotely configure schedules and automation rules for your deployments
- dynamically provision infrastructure using [workers](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/push-runs-remote)

<Note>
**Connect to Prefect Cloud or a self-hosted Prefect server instance**

Some features in this tutorial, such as scheduling, require you to connect to a Prefect server.
If using a self-hosted setup, run `prefect server start` to run both the webserver and UI.
If using Prefect Cloud, make sure you have 
[successfully authenticated your local environment](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/connect-to-cloud).

</Note>

## Deployment schema

Here's the complete schema that defines a deployment:

```python
class Deployment:
    """
    Structure of the schema defining a deployment
    """

    # required defining data
    name: str 
    flow_id: UUID
    entrypoint: str
    path: Optional[str] = None

    # workflow scheduling and parametrization
    parameters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    parameter_openapi_schema: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    schedules: list[Schedule] = None
    paused: bool = False
    trigger: Trigger = None

    # metadata for bookkeeping
    version: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None
    tags: Optional[list] = None

    # worker-specific fields
    work_pool_name: Optional[str] = None
    work_queue_name: Optional[str] = None
    infra_overrides: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    pull_steps: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

All methods for creating Prefect deployments are interfaces for populating this schema. 
The following sections explain each component in more detail.

### Required data

Deployments universally require a `name` and a reference to an underlying `Flow`.

The deployment name is not required to be unique across all deployments, but is required to be unique 
for a given flow ID. This means you will often see references to the deployment's unique identifying name 
`{FLOW_NAME}/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`.

For example, triggering a run of a deployment from the Prefect CLI can be done with:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
prefect deployment run my-first-flow/my-first-deployment
```
</div>

The other two fields are:

- **`path`**: think of the path as the runtime working directory for the flow. 
For example, if a deployment references a workflow defined within a Docker image, the `path` is the  
absolute path to the parent directory where that workflow will run anytime the deployment is triggered. 
This interpretation is more subtle in the case of flows defined in remote filesystems.
- **`entrypoint`**: the entrypoint of a deployment is a relative reference to a function decorated as a 
flow that exists on some filesystem. It is always specified relative to the `path`. 
Entrypoints use Python's standard path-to-object syntax 
(for example, `path/to/file.py:function_name` or simply `path:object`).

The entrypoint must reference the same flow as the flow ID.

Prefect requires that deployments reference flows defined _within Python files_.
Flows defined within interactive REPLs or notebooks cannot currently be deployed as such. 
They are still valid flows that will be monitored by the API and observable in the UI whenever they are run, 
but Prefect cannot trigger them.

<Note>
**Deployments do not contain code definitions**

Deployment metadata references code that exists in potentially diverse locations within your environment.
This separation means that your flow code stays within your storage and execution 
infrastructure, and never lives on the Prefect server or database.

This is key to the Prefect hybrid model: there's a boundary between your proprietary assets, 
such as your flow code, and the Prefect backend (including [Prefect Cloud](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/)). 
</Note>

### Scheduling and parametrization

One of the primary motivations for creating deployments of flows is to remotely _schedule_ and _trigger_ them.
Just as you can call flows as functions with different input values, deployments can be triggered or 
scheduled with different values through parameters.

These are the fields to capture the required metadata for those actions:

- **`schedules`**: a list of [schedule objects](/3.0rc/automate/add-schedules/).
Most of the convenient interfaces for creating deployments allow users to avoid creating this object themselves.
For example, when [updating a deployment schedule in the UI](/3.0rc/automate/add-schedules/#creating-schedules-through-the-ui) 
basic information such as a cron string or interval is all that's required.
- **`trigger`** (Cloud-only): triggers allow you to define event-based rules for running a deployment.
For more information see [Automations](/3.0rc/automate/events/automations-triggers/).
- **`parameter_openapi_schema`**: an [OpenAPI compatible schema](https://swagger.io/specification/) that defines 
the types and defaults for the flow's parameters.
This is used by the UI and the backend to expose options for creating manual runs as well as type validation.
- **`parameters`**: default values of flow parameters that this deployment will pass on each run.
These can be overwritten through a trigger or when manually creating a custom run.
- **`enforce_parameter_schema`**: a boolean flag that determines whether the API should validate the parameters 
passed to a flow run against the schema defined by `parameter_openapi_schema`.

<Tip>
**Scheduling is asynchronous and decoupled**

Pausing a schedule, updating your deployment, and other actions reset your auto-scheduled runs.
</Tip>

#### Run a deployed flow from within Python flow code

Prefect provides a [`run_deployment` function](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/deployments/deployments/#prefect.deployments.deployments.run_deployment) 
to schedule the run of an existing deployment when your Python code executes.

```python
from prefect.deployments import run_deployment

def main():
    run_deployment(name="my_flow_name/my_deployment_name")
```

<Tip>
**Run a deployment without blocking**

By default, `run_deployment` blocks until the scheduled flow run finishes
executing. Pass `timeout=0` to return immediately and not block.
</Tip>
    
If you call `run_deployment` from within a flow or task, the scheduled flow
run is linked to the calling flow run (or the calling task's flow run)
as a nested flow run by default.

Nested flow runs have different behavior than regular flow runs. For example, you can't suspend a 
nested flow run independently of its parent flow run. 
To prevent the flow run triggered by `run_deployment` from being linked to the flow run from which the method was called,
pass `as_subflow=False` to disable it:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.deployments import run_deployment


@flow
def my_flow():
    # This flow run will not be linked to `my_flow` run as a child 
    run_deployment(name="my_other_flow/my_deployment_name", as_subflow=False)
```

The return value of `run_deployment` is a [FlowRun](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/client/schemas/#prefect.client.schemas.objects.FlowRun) 
object containing metadata about the scheduled run. Use this object to retrieve information 
about the run after calling
`run_deployment`:

```python
from prefect import get_client
from prefect.deployments import run_deployment

def main():
    flow_run = run_deployment(name="my_flow_name/my_deployment_name")
    flow_run_id = flow_run.id

    # If you save the flow run's ID, you can use it later to retrieve
    # flow run metadata again, e.g. to check if it's completed.
    async with get_client() as client:
        flow_run = client.read_flow_run(flow_run_id)
        print(f"Current state of the flow run: {flow_run.state}")
```

<Tip>
**Using the Prefect client**

For more information on using the Prefect client to interact with Prefect's
REST API, see [Interact with the API](/3.0rc/manage/interact-with-api/).
</Tip>

## Versioning and bookkeeping

Here is important information on the versions, descriptions, and tags fields:

- **`version`**: versions are always set by the client and can be any arbitrary string. 
We recommend tightly coupling this field on your deployments to your software development lifecycle. 
For example if you leverage `git` to manage code changes, use either a tag or commit hash in this field. 
If you don't set a value for the version, Prefect will compute a hash.
- **`description`**: provide reference material such as intended use and parameter documentation. 
Markdown is accepted. The docstring of your flow function is the default value.
- **`tags`**: group related work together across a diverse set of objects. 
Tags set on a deployment are inherited by that deployment's flow runs. Filter, customize views, and 
searching by tag.

<Tip>
**Everything has a version**

Deployments have a version attached; and flows and tasks also have 
versions set through their respective decorators. These versions are sent to the API 
anytime the flow or task runs, allowing you to audit changes.
</Tip>

### Workers and work pools

[Work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/work-pools/) and [workers](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/workers/) are an advanced deployment pattern that 
allow you to dynamically provision infrastructure for each flow run.
The work pool job template interface allows users to create and govern opinionated interfaces 
to their workflow infrastructure.
To do this, a deployment using workers needs the following fields:

- **`work_pool_name`**: the name of the work pool this deployment is associated with.
Work pool types mirror infrastructure types, which means this field impacts the options available 
for the other fields.
- **`work_queue_name`**: if you are using work queues to either manage priority or concurrency, you can 
associate a deployment with a specific queue within a work pool using this field.
- **`infra_overrides`**: often called `job_variables` within various interfaces, this field allows 
deployment authors to customize whatever infrastructure options have been exposed on this work pool.
This field is often used for Docker image names, Kubernetes annotations and limits, 
and environment variables.
- **`pull_steps`**: a JSON description of steps that retrieves flow code or 
configuration, and prepares the runtime environment for workflow execution.

Pull steps allow users to highly decouple their workflow architecture.
For example, a common use of pull steps is to dynamically pull code from remote filesystems such as 
GitHub with each run of their deployment.

### Serving flows on long-lived infrastructure

When you have several flows running regularly, [the `serve` method](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/#serving-a-flow) 
of the `Flow` object or [the `serve` utility](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/#serving-multiple-flows-at-once) 
is a great option for managing multiple flows simultaneously.

Once you have authored your flow and decided on its deployment settings, run this long-running 
process in a location of your choosing.
The process stays in communication with the Prefect API, monitoring for work and submitting each run 
within an individual subprocess.
Because runs are submitted to subprocesses, any external infrastructure configuration 
must be set up beforehand and kept associated with this process.

This approach has these benefits:

- Users are in complete control of their infrastructure, and anywhere the "serve" Python process can 
run is a suitable deployment environment.
- It is simple to reason about.
- Creating deployments requires a minimal set of decisions.
- Iteration speed is fast.

### Dynamically provisioning infrastructure with work pools

Consider running flows on dynamically provisioned 
infrastructure with work pools under these circumstances:

- Flows that have expensive infrastructure due to the long-running process.
- Flows with heterogeneous infrastructure needs across runs.
- Large volumes of deployments.
- If your internal team structure requires that deployment authors be members of a different team 
than the team managing infrastructure.

[Work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/work-pools/) allow Prefect to exercise greater control 
of the infrastructure on which flows run.
Options for [serverless work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/push-runs-remote/) allow you to 
scale to zero when workflows aren't running.
Prefect even provides you with the ability to 
[provision cloud infrastructure via a single CLI command](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/push-runs-serverless/#automatically-creating-a-new-push-work-pool-and-provisioning-infrastructure), 
if you use a Prefect Cloud push work pool option.

With work pools:

- You can configure and monitor infrastructure configuration within the Prefect UI.
- Infrastructure is ephemeral and dynamically provisioned.
- Prefect is more infrastructure-aware and collects more event data from your infrastructure by default.
- Highly decoupled setups are possible.

<Note>
**You don't have to commit to one approach**

You can mix and match approaches based on the needs of each flow. You can also change the 
deployment approach for a particular flow as its needs evolve.
For example, you might use workers for your expensive machine learning pipelines, 
but use the serve mechanics for smaller, more frequent file-processing pipelines.
