description: Learn what deployments are and how to use them in Prefect.

[Deployments](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/prefect-deploy/) are server-side representations of flows. 
They store the crucial metadata for remote orchestration including when, where, and 
how a workflow should run.

Attributes of a deployment include:

- **Flow entrypoint**: path to your flow function
- **Schedule** or **Trigger**: optional schedule or triggering rules for this deployment
- **Tags**: optional text labels for organizing deployments

Some of the most common reasons to use an orchestration tool like Prefect are for 
[scheduling](/3.0rc/automate/add-schedules/) and [event-based triggering](/3.0rc/automate/events/automations-triggers/).
As opposed to manually triggering and managing flow runs, deploying a flow exposes an API and 
UI that allow you to:

- trigger new runs, [cancel active runs](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/#cancel-a-flow-run), 
pause scheduled runs, customize parameters, and more
- remotely configure schedules and automation rules for your deployments
- dynamically provision infrastructure using [workers](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/push-runs-remote)

<Note>
**Connect to Prefect Cloud or a self-hosted Prefect server instance**

Some features in this tutorial, such as scheduling, require you to connect to a Prefect server.
If using a self-hosted setup, run `prefect server start` to run both the webserver and UI.
If using Prefect Cloud, make sure you have 
[successfully authenticated your local environment](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/connect-to-cloud).
