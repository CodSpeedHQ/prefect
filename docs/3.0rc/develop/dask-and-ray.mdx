title: Run tasks in parallel on Dask or Ray
description: Learn how to use the Prefect Dask and Ray task runners for parallel or distributed task execution.

## Parallel task execution

Many real-world data workflows benefit from truly parallel, distributed task execution.
Use Dask or Ray in your flows to choose the execution environment that fits your particular needs.

- `DaskTaskRunner` runs tasks requiring parallel execution using
[`dask.distributed`](http://distributed.dask.org/).
- `RayTaskRunner` runs tasks requiring parallel execution using [Ray](https://www.ray.io/).

These task runners can spin up a local Dask cluster or Ray instance on the fly, or let you connect with a Dask or Ray environment you've
set up separately. This enables you to take advantage of massively parallel computing environments.

## Use multiple task runners

Many workflows include a variety of tasks, and not all of them benefit from parallel execution.

Because task runners are specified on flows, you can assign different task runners to tasks by using
[nested flows](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/#composing-flows) to organize those tasks.

This example uses the default `ThreadPoolTaskRunner`. Then you call a `ray_greetings()` nested flow that
uses the `RayTaskRunner` to execute the same tasks in a Ray instance.

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect_ray.task_runners import RayTaskRunner

@task
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"hello {name}")

@task
def say_goodbye(name):
    print(f"goodbye {name}")

@flow(task_runner=RayTaskRunner())
def ray_greetings(names):
    for name in names:
        say_hello.submit(name)
        say_goodbye.submit(name)

@flow()
def greetings(names):
    for name in names:
        say_hello.submit(name)
        say_goodbye.submit(name)
    ray_greetings(names)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greetings(["arthur", "trillian", "ford", "marvin"])
```

If you save this as `ray_nested_flow.py` and run it, you'll see that the flow `greetings` runs as you'd expect for a concurrent flow. Then flow `ray-greetings` spins up a Ray instance to run the tasks again.
